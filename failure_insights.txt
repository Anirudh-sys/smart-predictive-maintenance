INSIGHTS:
A tool wear failure indicates that cutting tools used in the CNC have become dull or worn out, reducing precision and efficiency. Regular inspections for abnormal sound or vibration can detect this early on. Quick Maintenance Steps: (1) Inspect current cutters; replace if excessive play is detected. (2) Schedule frequent tool changes to prevent work-hardening of tools. (3) Implement a predictive maintenance schedule based on usage and wear patterns.
